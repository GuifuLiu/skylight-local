        <p>Website accessibility statement inline with Public Sector Body (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018</p>
        <p>The University of Edinburgh Collections website is run by the University of Edinburgh. It links to a number of sub sites which have their own accessibility statements.</p>
        <p>We want as many people as possible to be able to read the journal content hosted on the platform. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
            <li>magnify the content</li>
            <li>Experience no time limits to content</li>
            <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
            <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
            <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We&rsquo;ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>
        <p>Customising the website</p>

        <p>How we tested this website</p>
        <p>This website was last tested in November 2019. The website was tested by the University of Edinburgh&rsquo;s Disability Information Officer on a PC using Internet Explorer (11.0.9600.19236) browser and also using the automated Webaim WAVE tool. Internet Explorer was chosen as the browser due to it being the most commonly used browser by disabled people as shown in the government survey: <a href="https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/11/01/results-of-the-2016-gov-uk-assistive-technology-survey/">the Government Assistive Technology Browser Survey</a></p>
        <p>We tested:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spellcheck functionality</li>
            <li>Data validation</li>
            <li>Scaling using different screen resolutions</li>
            <li>Options to customise the interface (magnification, font, background colour etc.)</li>
            <li>Keyboard navigation</li>
            <li>Warning of links opening in a new tab or window</li>
            <li>Information conveyed in colour or sound only</li>
            <li>Flashing or scrolling text</li>
            <li>Operability if Javascript is disabled</li>
            <li>Use with screen reading software (eg. JAWS)</li>
            <li>Assistive Software such as TextHelp Read and Write, and Zoomtext</li>
            <li>Tooltips and text alternatives for any non-text content</li>
            <li>Time limits</li>
        </ul>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>What we're doing to improve accessibility</p>
        <p>We will continue to work with developers to address these issues and deliver a solution or suitable workaround and correct issues directly. We hope to have the majority of issues resolved by April 2022.</p>
        <p>We will continue to monitor the website will carry out further accessibility testing if significant changes are made to the user interface or if a service user raises an issue.</p>
        <p>Whist we are in the process of resolving these accessibility issues we will of course ensure reasonable adjustments are in place to make sure no user is disadvantaged.</p>
