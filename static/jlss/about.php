                is dedicated to preserving Scotland's Jewish heritage. Since 1987 we have 
                been collecting historic material relating to the experiences of Jewish people in Scotland over the past 200 
                years. We document, preserve, exhibit and publish aspects of the collections and make the collections available 
                for education, academic research, tourists and visitors of all kinds.  We welcome research enquiries and visitors 
                and organise regular <a href="https://www.sjac.org.uk/news-events/" target="_blank" alt="link to the SJAC website" title="Click to visit the SJAC news and events page">Open Days</a> and events.

                alt="link to the JLSS blog page" title="Click to visit the JLSS blog">Jewish Lives, Scottish

                and Humanities Research Council</a>. It was a joint project between the Universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow that ran

            </p>
            <p>As Jews in Scotland moved between and within, into and out of local and transnational spaces, the objects they saved, used 
                and created reveal how Jews self-identified as they negotiated issues such as antisemitism, assimilation, cultural loss, 
                memory and the Holocaust, nationalism and belonging. The materiality of such Scottish Jewish ‘memory objects’ testifies to 
                the visibility of aspects of the past in the immediate environment of people’s new lives in Scotland. The location and placement 
                of these items within a Scottish landscape offers a rich ground for the investigation of various processes of cultural transition 
                and provides a link to the study of the city and Jewish space, thus making the best use of the available archival resources and 
                material evidence.
